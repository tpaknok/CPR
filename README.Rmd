The package CPR address phylogenetic non-independence between species in community analyses.

# Installation

You can install the development version of CPR from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("tpaknok/CPR")
```

# Background
While species are known to be non-independent due to shared evolutionary history, this is rarely considered in community-level analyses. Additionally, communities are not statistically indepedent if there are species overlap (which is often the case).

The analysis accounts for non-independence between species within communities using Bayesian GLMM. 

Composition matrices in presence/absence, number of individuals, percent cover, biomass etc can be used. Matrices based on scoring systems with uneven intervals can also be used (e.g., DAFOR), but this can lead to interpretation issues.

Users can calculate the variance-covariance matrix based on any phylogeny model (e.g. Brownian motions).

If the resulting variance-covariance matrix is not positive definite, nearPD from the Matrix package will be applied to find the nearest positive definite matrix. Without a positive definite matrix PGLS will fail to run.

Please make sure both the species compositional matrix and phylogenetic matrix have identical species name (e.g., space denoted as ” “, not”_” or “.”).

“get_comm_pair_r” will return a variance-covariance matrix at the community level, which can be used in gls (from nlme).

likelihood_lambda.R were extracted from Revell et al. (2010, Methods in Ecology & Evolution). Similar with PGLS, the function optimizes the phylogenetic covariance matrix by minimizing log-likelihood. By default the lambda value is restricted to 0-1.

Other functions are used for the simulations / empirical analyses and producing figures

Note that we are using Bayesian GLMM rather than Frequentist GLMM to improve the speed.

# Known problems
Might need to use inla.rerun to enhance model stability

It is possible that communities are indeed independent sample even if there are species overlap. In those cases the optimization of lambda will produce unstable results. A fix is to 1) re-run optimization several times to see if results are largely stable and 2) compare wAIC between models with optimized lambda and with independence assumption. If the model with optimized lambda doesn’t perform better, users can use the model assuming communities are independent.

Note that even with the same phylogenetic matrix, INLA will give different results across runs. So re-running the model will give different slightly different results (if phylogeny is important). If phylogeny is unimportant, INLA will give very unstable results, as the wAIC of all lambda values are driven by random fluctutation across runs.
